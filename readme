easy to use codeql
CodeQL itself consists of two parts:

CLI: The parsing engine is used to parse the rules we write. Although it is not open source, it can be downloaded directly from the official website and used directly.

SDK: The SDK is completely open source and contains most of the existing vulnerability rules. You can also use it to write custom rules.

1/First download the parsing engine CodeQL CLI, an executable command-line tool that allows you to run CodeQL analysis, create a CodeQL database, and develop and test custom CodeQL queries using the CodeQL CLI.
https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries/releases
windows:codeql-win64  linux:codeql-linux64

2/Add to the system environment variable PATH:
windows: windows Properties Added system path
linux:sudo vim /etc/profile   "i"to insert     "esc"to quit ":"to save "wq"to save and quit

3/Then download the CodeQL SDK, the standard scanning rules CodeQL libraries and queries. The following repository contains the standard CodeQL library and query statements:
https://github.com/github/codeql  
extract to the same root directory as the parsing engine

also can use vscode-codeql-starter
git clone --recursive https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql-starter/
git submodule update --init
git submodule update --remote

4/ install codeql in vscode and add the CLI path to CodeQL
add cli path in CodeQL in vscode:
choose CodeQL "setting" --> Extension settings  add the CLI
windows: D:/path/codeql.exe
linux: /home/path/codeql


5/open starter workspace in vscode
choose open workspace from file , select vscode-codeql-starter.code-workspace and add

6/add database 
just like this:
codeql database create path1 --language = "java" --source-root= path2
path1 is the create database path
path2 is the old database path

7/Import database
in vscode:choose Leftmost column codeql 
"add a codeql database " -->choose the database

8/choose a ql file and Right-click,click the "Codeql run query" or  "run query on select database"
